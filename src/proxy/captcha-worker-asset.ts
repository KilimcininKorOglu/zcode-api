 * captcha-worker-asset.ts — sole carrier of Bun's `with { type: "file" }`
 * import: it is what embeds the pre-bundled worker into `bun build --compile`
 * binaries (`new Worker(new URL(...))` does not survive compilation).
 *
 * Importers must reach this file via DYNAMIC import only: the asset is a
 * gitignored build input whose absence means "solve in-process" (see
 * captcha-worker-dispatch.ts).
